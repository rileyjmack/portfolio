Using a combination of archival images from the 1950s construction period through today, the project allows viewers to:

- Compare historical photographs with present-day views through an interactive slider
- Explore the iconic murals by artists like Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros
- Understand how the modernist campus design by architects Mario Pani and Enrique del Moral transformed Mexican architecture
- Visualize the growth of the campus from its initial construction to its current state as a UNESCO World Heritage site

Built with modern web technologies, the interface provides an intuitive way to experience how this remarkable example of Mexican modernist architecture has evolved over seven decades while maintaining its original vision of integrating art, architecture, and education.
