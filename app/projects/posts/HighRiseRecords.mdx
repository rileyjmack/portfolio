Grace Shopper Tiers Tier 1: MVP Shopping Experience As a customer/visitor, I want
to be able to:

access a deployed version of the website so I can browse and purchase
products.

view all available products so I can pick from a variety.

view a single product so I can see more details.

add a product to my cart so I can collect my desired products in one place.

edit my cart if I change my mind:

change the quantity of a product in my cart.

remove a product in my cart.

No one else should be able to edit my cart except me.

"checkout" the items in my cart so I can purchase my desired goods.

Think of a typical user experience on popular websites from a guest user and logged-in
user perspective.

You can just start with by simulating the experience of checking
out with a simple confirmation page.

create an account so I can have a logged-in experience.

As a logged-in customer, I want to be able to: have a persistent cart
so I can revisit and pick up where I left off.

Logged-in-user across multiple devices:

I'm logged in on my mobile device and add some items to my cart. When I open the
browser on my laptop and log in, I want to see those items in my cart. No one else
should be able to edit my cart except me. As an administrator, I want to be able
to: have validated data to ensure reliability. i.e. each customer that creates an
account should only be able to do so once with a single email address. have full
rights to make backend requests to add, edit, and remove products. No one else should
have access. view user information. No one else should have access. As an engineer,
I want to: have a well-seeded database so that I am able to simulate a number of
different scenarios for the user stories below. By doing this, you really set yourselves
up to tackle many of the points throughout the tiers. In the long run, this will
save you, potentially, tons of time. For example, seed hundreds of products with
dummy data so that when you get to the “pagination” user story, you won’t have to
worry about adding more products. Likewise, add a bunch of users with products in
their carts so editing the cart can be worked on without already having the “add
to cart” functionality built out. user data to be secure so that no one can unrightfully
manipulate information.
